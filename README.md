# forkify project

Recipe application with custome recipe uploads.

This is a project from a Udemy course called 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022:
From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann (https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@tJTVy1vpHhZCQdDJhMBlalvS2v52P3NiXdgwF9KxbhJWLDIRxhRwKV_4IrTCn67iHg==/).

In future commits I will add my own touch to this project
